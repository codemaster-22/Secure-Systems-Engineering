The address 0x5bc300c corresponds to got table entry address for the printf
the address 0xf7e41950 corresponds to system function address

So we are setting the content of 0x5bc300c to  0xf7e41950 , by using format string vulnerabilty 

for this we are writing 2 bytes 0x1950 starting from 0x05bc300c ,and 2 bytes 0xf7e4 starting from 0x05bc300e

In decimal: 63460 corresponds to 0xf7e4
In decimal: 6480  corresponds to 0x1950

the below is the string that we are passing into printf

"\x0c\x30\xbc\x05\x0e\x30\xbc\x05 %6470x %7$hn %56978x %8$hn"

We found out that if the format string is like this then 
7th argument will be 0x05bc300c
8th argument will be 0x05bc300e

and %a$hn will store the number of charcters that are printed till now in (2 bytes) at the ath argument

so by this way we are changing the content of got table enty of printf to system in 1st iteration

in 2nd iteration we are passing "xterm", so this string will be argument to this system function and we can open xterm by this.
